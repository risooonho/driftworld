DRIFTWORLD is a 2D real time strategy game about patience, conquest, and control.

Gather your units and outmaneuver the enemy, claiming their bases for your own. But beware, control can be a finicky thing. Will you persevere and charge ahead to complete your conquest? And, in the end... will it have been worth it?

## Controls

- Left-click to select units
- Right-click to move them
- Scroll wheel to zoom
- WASD to pan the camera, or move the mouse to the edge of the screen
- C to cancel a move (while selected)
- R to reset the level
- Esc to exit

## GMTK Game Jam
