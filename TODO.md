# TODOs

Basics:
- Enemy AI!!!!!!
  - Defensive: just keeps all units around, but attacks those attacking it
  - Stupid: sends all new units to attack nearest non-self base immediately
  - Strategic: builds a small army first, then attacks neutral bases in order to capture
      - leaves some behind to defend
      - if army is dying, will attempt to flee
      - if base under attack, will redirect units to defend

Important:
- Playtesting

Levels:
- Level1 (only a neutral base)
- Level2 (enemy base and neutral base)
- Level3 (multiple enemy bases and neutral bases)

Next:
- Background music
- Sound effects
- Title screen
- End screen
- Level victory message
- Eradication message
- Hint messages

Polish:
- Bloom effect
- UI for Unit / base counts for each player
- Death animation
- Spawn animation
- Cursor animation
- Attack particle effect
- Unit trail animation
- Base capture color animation
- Base capture "swoosh" effect
- Background space particles
- Camera edge scrolling
- Max units (based on # of total bases, I guess)
- Collision avoidance
- Change default clear color subtly depending on who has the most units?
- Buildup-guage based way of base takeover?
- Scoring system? :O
- Save data + level selector?

Bugs:
- Fix motion jankiness when becoming defector
- HP bar is sometimes below units

Extras:
- Towers
- Tower capture
- Tower attacks
  - AOE?
- More unit / base types!
